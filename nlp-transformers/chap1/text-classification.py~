text = """Dear Amazon, last week I ordered an Optimus Prime action figure \
from your online store in Germany. Unfortunately, when I opened the package, \
I discovered to my horror that I had been sent an action figure of Megatron \
instead! As a lifelong enemy of the Decepticons, I hope you can understand my \
dilemma. To resolve the issue, I demand an exchange of Megatron for the \
Optimus Prime figure I ordered. Enclosed are copies of my records concerning \
this purchase. I expect to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Bumblebee."""
